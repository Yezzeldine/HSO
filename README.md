Welcome to the MIST High School Outreach Tool!

This is a brief guide on how to use this sheet to assist in the process of identifying and researching public high schools in your region. MAKE A COPY FOR REGIONAL USE! You will not be able to use this version as it is a public copy design for duplication.

1. Below, you will find a list of each region, along with the counties in your ACTIVE JURISDICTION. You are welcome to reach out to counties not listed here so long as they (A) do not belong to another region and (B) fall within your PASSIVE JURISDICTION

2. On the "High School Finder" sheet, select a state in cell A1 and it will display all the high schools in that state (probably the easiest course of action if you are Florida or NJ). To specify a county, select from the dropdown in cell B2. Use this sheet as a reference for the counties in your jurisdiction

3. The "Research Tracker" will automatically populate with the schools being displayed on the "High School Finder." To use, simply copy the county and school name from columns A and B, paste into google, copy the link to the school website, and put it into column C. You can use column D to help record information on MSAs. I use the following nomenclature:

YES: Yes, there is an active MSA
NO: No, there is not an active MSA
N/A: There is no available club listing on the school website
OLD: There is an outdated club listing on the school website
NOACC: There is an inaccessible club listing on the school website (domain access only).

Notes:
- Sorry Canadians, US Federal database only, you're on your own with Canadian high schools
- If you want to put data from multiple countries on the research tracker, you'll need to do one county at a time, then copy that info onto a new sheet (If you do it on the current "Research Tracker" then it will break the auto population). OR, DM me asking very nicely and I can do it much faster for you :)
- Sometimes automation leads to typos and silly mistakes ;( common sense is usually a good cure for that. If something is really not adding up though, please let me know and I will do my best to help.
